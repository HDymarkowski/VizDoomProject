-- Phase 1 --

Ran with lr = 0.0001, accumulate_episodes = 4 and difficulty = 1
Also had a damage reward for damage taken:
	> episode_reward - (total_damage_taken * 0.2)

model 0
	> sucks
	> Goes to kill both of them
	> Kills then just kinda gets stuck
	> Does a shite job of killing them

model 2000
	> turns keeps shooting and walks backwards
	> Gets past the first door (soemtimes kills both of the guys) then just runs backwards and dies

model 4000 kinda the same

so is model 6000

so is model 8000

so is model 10000

so is model 12000

so is model 14000

We lost the log data for the first 1000

We should just go from 4000ds 


Why is it just turning
	> Difficulty too low - low insentive to kill cause can still get decent reward by just running -> Turn up difficulty
	> Not getting penalised enough for getting hit?
	> Want to insentivise killing maybe by adding a reward for each kill

Gonna train from model_4000 and set i = 4000

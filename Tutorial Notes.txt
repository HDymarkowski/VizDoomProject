GOT TO :  "Animtaion 3"

I need to run through powershell
I am using the wrong interpereter in vsc

state.screen_buffer is the frame of the game (state = game.get_state())
State is like all the important info of the game in that frame'

THE IDEA:
	> VizDOOM rewards system but instead of using reinforcement learning we use the game.get_state().screen_buffer image to make the decisions

Look at the plt.imshow() stuff about an hour in

Jupyter notebook might be a cool way of running this


PPO Things you get as output (1 hr 31 mins in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBCU-tqLGfQ):
	> approx_kl = how different current agent is vs new agent, if it spikes then we are getting unstable learinign
		- Should vary but not spikes
		- PPO deals with this via clipping
	> explained variaence = measure of how well our critic model is able to explain the varience of the value function
		- You want it to be +vr cause that means our critic model is able to predict the value of the current state in a lto more detail
	> policy_gradient_loss = how well our agent is able to take actions to capitalise on its advantage
		- You want to see this decrease, meaning our loss is decreasing, meaning our agent is able to better capitalize on advantage
		- Very important, apparently
		- Fluxuates a lot in the start, then heads down
	> Value loss = how well our agent is actually able to predict the current return based on the current state in action
		- You want this to decrease too
